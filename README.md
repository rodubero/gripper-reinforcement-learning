# Optimization of grasping methods for an uderactuated gripper by reinforcement learning

This repository contains the files from my Special Assignment in Factory Automation (ASE-9517) at Tampere University in 2019.

This project aims to find a specific sequence of commands for the YOH T42 under-actuated gripper, using machine learning, formulating states and applying a Q-learning algorithm, to discover the shortest series of commands for picking up effectively a coin from a flat surface.

Find the code in the code folder. Sorry about the low end python implementation :)

Staff from [FASTLAB](https://www.tuni.fi/en/research/fast-lab) published [this article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274727) using material from my assignmet (Figure 4, 8 and 10, and most tables are exactly the same) :D, they also added authors who did not make any substantial contribution in the research process, ignoring the guidelines about authorship from the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity ([find it here](https://tenk.fi/sites/tenk.fi/files/TENK_suositus_tekijyys.pdf)). Hopefully some day someone will spot all the unethical practices in that research group.
